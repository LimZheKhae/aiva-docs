# Getting started

This guide walks you through your first login to both the admin dashboard and the member portal.

## Admin app — for staff

### Log in

1. Open your browser and go to your gym's admin URL (e.g., `admin.yourgym.com`).
1. Enter your staff email and password.
1. Click **Sign in**.

:::tip
If you don't have an account yet, ask your gym administrator to create one in **System Settings > User Management**. You'll receive an email with a link to set your password.
:::

### Navigate the dashboard

After logging in, you land on the **Dashboard** — your at-a-glance view of what's happening at the gym. The sidebar on the left organizes everything into sections:

| Section | What you'll find |
| --- | --- |
| **Dashboard** | Key metrics, action items, and today's schedule. |
| **Analytics** | Revenue trends, lead conversion, and marketing ROI. |
| **Members** | Member profiles, packages, payments, and attendance. |
| **Leads** | Prospect pipeline and follow-up tracking. |
| **Operations** | Package management, payment records, appointment scheduling, and point system. |
| **Staff** | Trainer schedules, commission reports, and staff profiles. |
| **Chats** | WhatsApp messaging with member enrichment. |
| **System Settings** | User management and permission configuration. |

The sidebar collapses on smaller screens — use the hamburger menu to expand it.

:::note
What you see depends on your role and permissions. Trainers see a focused view with their sessions, commission, and schedule. Admins and super admins see everything.
