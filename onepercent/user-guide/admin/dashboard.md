# Dashboard

The dashboard is the first screen you see after logging in. It gives you a snapshot of what's happening at your gym right now — today's sessions, key metrics, and items that need your attention.

:::note
The dashboard looks different depending on your role. **Admins and managers** see gym-wide performance data. **Trainers** see their own sessions and commission. This page covers both views.

## Admin dashboard

If you're an admin or manager, the dashboard is divided into three sections: key metrics, action items, and today's schedule.

### Key metrics

Four cards at the top show your gym's most important numbers:

| Card | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Active Members** | Total members with at least one active package. |
| **Today's Sessions** | Number of appointments scheduled for today. |
| **Outstanding** | Total unpaid balance across all member packages (in MYR). Hover over the card to see the exact amount. |
| **Pending Leads** | Number of new or engaged leads waiting for follow-up. |

#### Filter by branch

If you have access to all branches, a toggle appears below the greeting that lets you switch between **All Branches**, **Kepong**, and **Kota Damansara**. All metrics and lists update to reflect the selected branch.

Staff assigned to a single branch see data for their branch only — no toggle is shown.

### Action items

Below the metrics, four columns highlight things that need attention:

| Column | What it shows | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Expiring Soon** | Packages expiring within **7 days**. | These members need a renewal conversation now. |
| **Expiring** | Packages expiring within **8–30 days**. | Start the renewal conversation early. |
| **New Leads** | Leads with a status of "new" that haven't been contacted. | Fresh leads lose interest quickly. |
| **Redemptions** | Point redemptions waiting to be fulfilled. | Members are waiting for their rewards. |

Each column previews up to 3 items. Click **View All** to open a full list in a popup.

- Click a **member name** in the expiring packages list to go to their profile.
- Click a **lead** to go to the leads page.
- Click a **redemption** to go to the point system page.

### Today's schedule

A table showing all appointments for today, ordered by time. Each row displays the session time, member name, trainer, and status.

Appointment statuses you'll see:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Pending PT** | Waiting for the trainer to confirm. |
| **Pending** | Waiting for the member to acknowledge. |
| **Confirmed** | Both sides have confirmed the session. |
| **Acknowledged** | The member has acknowledged the booking. |
| **Completed** | The session has been completed. |
| **Cancelled** | The session was cancelled. |

If there are more than 8 sessions, a **View All Appointments** link takes you to the full appointments page filtered to today.

### Quick actions

Four shortcut buttons on the right side of the schedule let you jump to common tasks:

- **Add New Member** — Opens the member registration form.
- **Schedule Session** — Goes to the appointments page.
- **View Analytics** — Opens the analytics dashboard.
- **Manage Packages** — Goes to the package management page.

## Trainer dashboard

If you're a trainer, the dashboard focuses on your personal sessions and earnings.

### Today's progress

A circular progress ring shows how many of today's sessions you've completed out of your total scheduled sessions. Below it, two counters break down the numbers:

- **Completed** — Sessions you've finished today.
- **Upcoming** — Sessions still ahead of you.

### Month-to-date commission

A summary card shows your earnings for the current month, broken into:

| Line item | What it tracks |
| --- | --- |
| **Conduction Fee** | Earnings from sessions you've conducted, based on the commission rate for each session type. Also shows how many sessions this covers. |
| **Sales Commission** | Earnings from packages you've sold. |
| **Total Earnings** | Combined total for the month. |

Click **View Details** to go to the full commission report page.

### My sessions today

A table of your appointments for today, ordered by time. Each row shows:

- **Time** — Highlighted in red for upcoming sessions, muted with a strikethrough for completed ones.
- **Member name** — The member you're training (also muted and struck through for completed sessions).
- **Contact** — The member's phone number.
- **Status** — Current appointment status badge.

Completed sessions appear faded so you can focus on what's coming next.

If you have more than 8 sessions, a **View Full Schedule** link takes you to the trainer schedule page.

### Follow-up needed

A card listing members who have **3 or fewer sessions remaining** on their active package. These are your renewal opportunities — members close to running out of sessions are likely to need a new package.

Each row shows:

- Member name (clickable — takes you to their profile).
- Package name.
- Sessions remaining (highlighted in red if 1 or fewer).

If all your members have enough sessions, you'll see an "All Clear!" message.

Click **View All** to see the complete list if there are more than 4 members.

### Quick actions

Three shortcut buttons for your most common tasks:

- **View My Schedule** — Opens your trainer schedule.
- **Book Session** — Goes to the appointments page.
- **My Commission** — Opens your commission report.

## Things to keep in mind

- Dashboard data loads when you open the page. It doesn't update automatically in real time — refresh the page to see the latest numbers.
- The **Outstanding** amount on the admin dashboard includes all unpaid balances, not just overdue ones.
- Trainers only see their own sessions and commission. They don't have access to gym-wide metrics or other trainers' data.
