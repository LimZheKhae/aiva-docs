# Check in to a session

Record your attendance by tapping the check-in button when you arrive at the gym. Check-in is available during a time window around your session.

## Steps

### Open the attendance page

1. Tap the **Attendance** tab in the bottom navigation.

### Check in

1. Find your session under **Today's Sessions**.
1. Each session card shows your trainer's name, session time, and a status indicator.
1. When the check-in button is active, tap **Check In**.

A success overlay confirms your check-in with the session details.

## Check-in window

You can check in during a specific time window:

| Timing | Status | Can check in? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| More than 15 min before start | "Upcoming" — not yet available | No |
| 15 min before to start time | "Ready to Check In" | Yes |
| After start time to session end | "Late Check-in" | Yes |
| After session end | Window closed | No |

If you arrive early, the card shows a countdown until check-in opens.

## View attendance history

1. On the attendance page, tap **View History** (or scroll down to see recent sessions).
1. The history page shows:
   - **Pending check-ins** — past sessions you didn't check into (orange section).
   - **Completed sessions** — sessions with a recorded check-in (green section).
1. Tap **Load More** to see older sessions.

## Things to keep in mind

- Check-in is **button-based** — no QR code needed.
- Only **scheduled** sessions appear on the attendance page. Pending sessions (waiting for trainer confirmation) don't show up here.
- If you miss the check-in window, contact your trainer — they can record your attendance from the admin app.
- Your check-in time is recorded and visible to your trainer.
