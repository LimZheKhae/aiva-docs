# Getting started

This guide walks you through your first login to the Onepercent admin dashboard and covers the basics of navigation.

## Log in to the admin dashboard

1. Open your browser and go to your gym's admin URL (e.g., `admin.yourgym.com`).
2. Enter your staff email and password.
3. Click **Sign in**.

If you don't have an account yet, ask your gym administrator to send you an invite. You'll receive an email with a link to set your password.

## Navigate the dashboard

After logging in, you'll see the main dashboard with these sections in the sidebar:

- **Dashboard**: overview of key metrics and recent activity
- **Members**: manage member profiles, memberships, and check-ins
- **Leads**: track prospective members and follow-ups
- **Operations**: packages, payments, and point system management
- **Staff**: profiles, commission tracking, and trainer schedules
- **Settings**: gym configuration and user management
- **WhatsApp**: messaging integration

## Switch between pages

Click any item in the left sidebar to navigate. The sidebar collapses on smaller screens -- use the hamburger menu to expand it.

## Log out

Click your profile icon in the top-right corner and select **Sign out**.
