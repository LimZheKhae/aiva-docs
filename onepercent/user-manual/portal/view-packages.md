## What you'll see

### Active packages

Each package card shows:

- **Package name** and **trainer name**.
- **Expiry badge** — color-coded by urgency:
  - Red: 7 days or less remaining.
  - Orange: 8–30 days remaining.
  - Green: more than 30 days remaining.
- **Session progress bar** — visual indicator of sessions used vs. total. Colors match how many sessions are left:
  - Red: under 25% remaining.
  - Orange: 25–50% remaining.
  - Green: over 50% remaining.
- **Bonus gym access** — a gift icon badge if the package includes gym-only sessions.
- **Start and end dates**.
- **Branch** — which gym location.

### Training programs

Below your packages, three informational cards show the gym's available program tiers:

| Program | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| **Strong** | Build strength. |
| **Express** | Shorter, efficient sessions. |
| **Burn** | Fat loss and body shaping. |

These are for reference only — to purchase a new package, contact your gym.

## Things to keep in mind

- You can have multiple active packages at the same time (e.g., different trainers or programs).
- The session count shown here matches what appears in the booking wizard. If you have 2 sessions remaining, you can book up to a 60-minute session.
- Expired packages still appear but are marked as expired. You can't book sessions against them.
- To renew or purchase a new package, speak with your trainer or gym staff.
