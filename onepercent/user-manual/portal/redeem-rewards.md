# Redeem rewards

Browse the rewards catalog, redeem items with your loyalty points, and collect them at the gym using a QR code.

## View your points

1. Tap the **Profile** tab, then tap **My Points** (or tap the **Points** stat card).

<!-- ![Points page with balance](./assets/redeem-rewards-points.png) -->

Your points page shows:

- **Balance card** — your current spendable points (gold gradient).
- **How to Earn** — info on how you earn points (sessions, purchases).
- **Redeem Rewards** — link to the rewards catalog.
- **Points History** — scrollable list of all transactions (earn and redeem) with running balances.

## Browse the catalog

1. On the points page, tap **Redeem Rewards**.
1. The **Catalog** tab shows all available merchandise.

<!-- ![Rewards catalog grid](./assets/redeem-rewards-catalog.png) -->

Each item card shows:

- Product image.
- Name and category.
- Points cost.
- Green checkmark if you can afford it.
- Dimmed appearance if you don't have enough points.

## Redeem an item

1. Tap an item you can afford.
1. The **Redeem Modal** opens showing:
   - Item details (image, name, description).
   - Points breakdown: your balance, the cost, and remaining points after redemption.
1. Tap **Redeem Now**.

### Success screen

After redeeming, a full-screen success overlay appears with:

- A **QR code** — show this at the gym counter.
- A **redemption code** (e.g., `RPT-26022500001`) — in case the QR code can't be scanned.
- An animated success badge.

## Collect your reward

1. Go to the gym.
1. Show the QR code (or tell the staff your redemption code).
1. Staff scans or looks up your code and marks it as fulfilled.
1. The status updates from **Pending** to **Fulfilled** in real time — you'll see it change on your screen.

## Track your rewards

1. On the rewards page, tap the **My Rewards** tab.

The badge shows your pending redemption count.

### Sections

- **Ready to Collect** — pending items. Tap to show the QR code again.
- **Collection History** — fulfilled and cancelled items. Tap **Show More** to see older entries.

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Pending** | Waiting to be collected at the gym. |
| **Fulfilled** | Collected. |
| **Cancelled** | Cancelled by staff — points refunded. |

## Things to keep in mind

- Points don't expire.
- You can only redeem items that match your gym branch (or items set to "All Branch").
- If you change your mind, ask staff to cancel the redemption — your points are refunded automatically.
- The rewards page updates in **real time**. When staff fulfills your redemption, the status changes instantly without refreshing.
- The redemption code format is `RPT-YYMMDDXXXX` — you can use this code even if the QR can't be scanned.
