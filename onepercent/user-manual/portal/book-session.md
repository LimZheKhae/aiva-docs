# Book a session

Book a personal training session in three steps: choose your package, select a duration, and pick an available date and time.

## Before you begin

- You need an active package with remaining sessions.
- If you don't have a package, contact your gym to purchase one.

## Steps

### Open the booking wizard

1. Tap the **Book** tab in the bottom navigation.
1. Or tap **Book New Session** on the schedule page.

### Step 1: Select a package

1. Choose which package to use for this session.
1. Each card shows the package name, trainer, remaining sessions, and branch.

If you only have one active package, it's automatically selected.

### Step 2: Select a duration

1. Choose a session length: **30 min**, **60 min**, **90 min**, or **120 min**.
1. Available durations depend on your remaining sessions:
   - 1 session remaining → 30 min only.
   - 2 sessions → up to 60 min.
   - 3 sessions → up to 90 min.
   - 4+ sessions → up to 120 min.

### Step 3: Pick a date and time

1. **Select a date** from the calendar (up to 30 days ahead).
   - Available dates display normally.
   - Unavailable dates appear greyed out with strikethrough.
1. **Select a time slot** from the list below the calendar.
   - Open slots are tappable.
   - Already-booked slots are greyed out.
1. Tap **Book**.

### Confirmation

A success overlay appears showing your trainer's name and session time. You're redirected to the schedule page where the new session appears in your upcoming list.

## If no slots are available

If all time slots for your selected date are booked, a "Fully Booked" message appears. Try:

- Choosing a **different date**.
- Selecting a **shorter duration** (e.g., 30 min instead of 60 min).

## Things to keep in mind

- Portal bookings arrive with a **"Wait for trainer confirmation"** status. Your trainer needs to confirm before the session is final.
- Once confirmed, the status changes to **"Ready to attend"** with a green check.
- You **can't cancel** sessions from the portal. Contact your trainer or gym staff to cancel or reschedule.
- If someone else books the same slot while you're browsing, the slot updates to unavailable automatically.
